#### My approach will involve the following steps:

- Examine the number of residential units completed each month. Clean the relevant data and prepare it for the regression model.

- Next, analyze the number of absorbed residential units each month. Similar to the first step, this data will be prepared and cleaned.

- Subsequently, I'll save the average absorption price of single-family/attached homes, the target variable, for testing the trained model.

- Lastly, we look into the Housing Price Index (HPI), which gives us insights into the relative changes in housing prices over periods of time.

It should be noted that all training data used is aggregated and sourced from Statistics Canada, specific to Calgary, AB. Moreover, as the primary goal of this project is to provide me with hands-on practice in building and applying Multiple Linear Regression models, the focus is more on the process rather than the absolute accuracy of the model.
