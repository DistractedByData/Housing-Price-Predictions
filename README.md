# Predicting Housing Prices with Multiple Linear Regression

View the project [here](https://github.com/SoManyDistractions/Good-or-Bad-Rent/blob/main/Housing%20Market%20Price%20Predictions%20with%20MLR.ipynb)

#### The Data
All training data used is sourced from Statistics Canada. Moreover, as the primary goal of this project is to provide me with hands-on practice in building and applying Multiple Linear Regression models, the focus is more on the process rather than the absolute accuracy of the model.
